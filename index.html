                    Any time we watch a meteorologist predict a bad storm, we’re experiencing computer science in action. 
                    Every one of the tools used to monitor weather through satellites and radar comes because of some sort of computer science. 
                    Using those tools, computer science allows us to predict hurricanes, tornadoes, or even the outbreak of a potentially fatal disease. 
                    It can even be used to predict human behavior, which can help prevent crimes. 
                    Computer science can provide us with some life-saving tools and work.
